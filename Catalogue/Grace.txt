There's the moon asking to stay
Long enough for the clouds to fly me away
Oh, it's my time coming,
I'm not afraid
Afraid to die
My fading voice sings of love,
But she cries to the clicking of time.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Fire.
And she weeps on my arm
Walking to the bright lights in sorrow
Oh drink a bit of wine
We both might go tomorrow
Oh my love
And the rain is falling,
I believe my time has come
It reminds me of the pain
I might leave
Leave behind
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
And I feel them drown my name
So easy to know and forget with this kiss
I'm not afraid to go but it goes so slow
Wait, wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
Wait
Wait in the fire.
Wait in the fire.
